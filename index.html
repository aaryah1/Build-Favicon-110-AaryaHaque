    <p>I created the favicon by setting the bit number of 32 by 32 on a google spreadsheet. Instead of using binary numbers to create the color I used the fill in tool to color in each pixel. I selected the area I wanted to color and then using the color fill in tool I chose my color and slowly colored the pixels to develop my image. The color tool I used looks like a paint bucket and is pouring a droplet. After I was content with my favicon I downloaded it as a PDF and then I pressed the keys "windows+shift+S" to take a screenshot. You can also just search up the snipping tool on your computer and then save the image. I saved the image as a JPG and named it "Favicon." I went on replit and uploaded the file. Afterword, I coded using html so my favicon can show up on my web browser and I inserted the image file.</p>
